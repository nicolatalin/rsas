Hernandez-Castro\r\n   jch27@kent.ac.uk\r\n\r\n\r\n## RSAS is a forensic software which scans the system for traces of removed applications.\r\n\r\nRSAS uses a database of forensic artifacts which are left in the system after the removal of Steganography applications, to determine whether any of the applications in the database has ever been run in the target system. This operation is known as Forensic Steganalysis Triage and provides to the investigator in few seconds a report of which Steganography applications have been run in the system, even if such applications have been uninstalled or deleted.\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER:\r\n> The software comes as it is and the authors and the University of Kent take no responsibilities for any damange or consequence of using this software.\r\n\r\nLICENSE:\r\n> This software and its source code are available under [GPL v.3 License](./LICENSE)\r\n\r\n### [Watch on YouTube: RSAS How to detect if a portable Steganoraphy tool like OpenPuff has been used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMwhuUgdl5k)\r\n\r\n### [Watch on YouTube: RSAS How to detect uninstalled Steganoraphy tools](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJQbkJrY35Y)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## ===== INSTRUCTIONS FOR USERS:  =====\r\n\r\n\r\nRSAS works on Windows 7, 8 and 10.\r\n\r\n\r\n### WHICH FILE IS THE DISTRIBUTABLE AND EXECUTABLE VERSION OF RSAS:\r\n\r\nIn most cases you will just need:\r\n\r\n  [`/dist/rsas.exe`](./dist/rsas.exe)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### GETTING STARTED WITH RSAS:\r\n\r\nFirst, **download** [`/dist/rsas.exe`](./dist/rsas.exe).\r\n\r\nThen, if you wish to use the **Command Line Interface (recommended)**:\r\n\r\n> [Watch on YouTube RSAS Getting started with RSAS command line interface](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cF1o0xlFwDg)\r\n\r\n  1. Open the Start Menu of Windows and type `cmd`. The Command Prompt of Windows will appear in the search results.\r\n  2. Right click on the Command Prompt (`cmd.exe`) and select \"run as administrator\".\r\n  3. Use the command `cd` to navgate to the directory where `rsas.exe` is saved.\r\n  4. Use the command `rsas -h` to learn which options do you have with RSAS.\r\n  5. Use `rsas -c` to start an interactive console to use RSAS.\r\n  6. Use `rsas -e COMMAND` instead to directly execute the RSAS console command `COMMAND` without starting the console.\r\n  7. The RSAS console command `help` will show what are the RSAS console commands available.\r\n  8. The RSAS console commands `dbprintapps` and `dbprintarts` will print the applications and their artifacts descriptions from the database.\r\n  9. The RSAS console command `scan` will scan the system for artifacts matching the descriptions in database and will print a list of the detected applications.\r\n  10. The RSAS console commands `scanv` and `scanvv` will perform the scan and print the results more verbosely.\r\n  11. The RSAS console command `quit` will exit the console.\r\n  12. To save a report of your scan use the command: `rsas -e scanvv > report.txt`.\r\n  13. You can see information on RSAS and its authors with the console command `about`.\r\n\r\nIf instead you wish to use the **Graphical User Interface (very basic!)**:\r\n\r\n> [Watch on YouTube RSAS Getting started with RSAS graphical user interface](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49MXb5Ie-Bw)\r\n\r\n  1. Right click on `rsas.exe` and select \"run as administrator\".\r\n  2. RSAS comes with a minimal graphical interface which is only intended to help the investigators familiarise with the tool. The use of the command line interface is recommended.\r\n  3. From the to menu, the buttons `Apps` and `Arts` will print a list of the applications and of their artifacts from the database.\r\n  4. From the menu, the buttons `Scan`, `ScanV`, and `ScanVV`, will perform a scan of the system and print, with different levels of verbosity, the list of detected applications and artifacts.\r\n  5. From the menu, the button `About` will show information on RSAS and its authors\r\n  6. From the menu, the button `Quit` will close RSAS.\r\n  7. To save a report:\r\n    1. Select the scan results from the non-editable textarea using `CTRL`+`A` and copy t with `CTRL`+`C`;\r\n    2. Open a new empty text file;\r\n    3. Paste the scan results in the empty text file with `CTRL`+`V` and save it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### RUN RSAS AS ADMINISTRATOR:\r\n\r\nYou will probably need to run `rsas.exe` as administrator.\r\n\r\n#### How?\r\n> If you whish to use the Graphical User Interface, please right click on `rsas.exe` an select \"run as adminstrator\" from the contextual menu.\r\n> \r\n> If you wish to use the Command Line Interface, open the Start menu of Windows and type `cmd`. You will see the Command Prompt of Windows (`cmd.exe`) appear in the search results. Right click on it and select \"run as administrator\".\r\n> Now use the 'cd' command to navigate to the directory where `rsas.exe` is saved.\r\n> You can now use RSAS as described above.\r\n\r\n#### Why?\r\n> The current user might not have the rights to read some of the files and registry keys that RSAS is looking for to determine which Steganography applications have been run in the system. In order to be able to see and/or read those artifacts, it might be necessary to run RSAS as administrator.\r\n\r\n#### What if I don't do it?\r\n> Well, you will still be able to use RSAS to view the contents of the artifacts database, and you will be able to read the About information.\r\n>\r\n> You can also attempt to run a scan. As soon as RSAS will try to access a resource for which the current users have no rights, the scan will abort with a message asking to run RSAS as administrator.\r\n>\r\n> If you are using your customised database, including only artifact descriptions matching resources for which the current user has readig rights, you might not need to run RSAS as administrator to perform your scan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### DEPENDENCY ISSUES:\r\n\r\nOn Windows 8.1, Windows 8, and Windows 7, RSAS might throw this error when started:\r\n\r\n> The program can't start because api-ms-win-crt-math-l1-1-0.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem.\r\n\r\nIf this is the case, you will need to install in the target system the Windows Update Package KB2999226, which provides WinUCRT (Windows Universal C Runtime Libraries).\r\n\r\nYou can download it from the official Microsoft website: https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/kb/2999226\r\n\r\nor you can find it here on /redist/wincrt-redistributable/\r\n\r\nPlease select the correct installation file for your target os version:\r\n\r\n| Version of Windows in your taget system        | Update Installation File        | \r\n|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|\r\n| Windows Vista (32-bit) (not supported by RSAS) | [`Windows6.0-KB2999226-x86.msu`](./redist/wincrt-redistributable/Windows6.0-KB2999226-x86.msu)  |\r\n| Windows Vista (64-bit) (not supported by RSAS) | [`Windows6.0-KB2999226-x64.msu`](./redist/wincrt-redistributable/Windows6.0-KB2999226-x64.msu)  |\r\n| Windows 7 (32-bit)                             | [`Windows6.1-KB2999226-x86.msu`](./redist/wincrt-redistributable/Windows6.1-KB2999226-x86.msu)  |\r\n| Windows 7 (64-bit)                             | [`Windows6.1-KB2999226-x64.msu`](./redist/wincrt-redistributable/Windows6.1-KB2999226-x64.msu)  |\r\n| Windows 8.0 (32-bit)                           | [`Windows8-RT-KB2999226-x86.msu`](./redist/wincrt-redistributable/Windows8-RT-KB2999226-x86.msu) |\r\n| Windows 8.0 (64-bit)                           | [`Windows8-RT-KB2999226-x64.msu`](./redist/wincrt-redistributable/Windows8-RT-KB2999226-x64.msu) |\r\n| Windows 8.1 (32-bit)                           | [`Windows8.1-KB2999226-x86.msu`](./redist/wincrt-redistributable/Windows8.1-KB2999226-x86.msu)  |\r\n| Windows 8.1 (64-bit)                           | [`Windows8.1-KB2999226-x64.msu`](./redist/wincrt-redistributable/Windows8.1-KB2999226-x64.msu)  |\r\n| Windows 10 (any)                               | *update not needed*             |\r\n\r\nAfter installing the update, you should not need to reboot the system to be able to use RSAS.\r\n\r\n> [Watch on YouTube RSAS Installing WindowsUCRT to fix dependency error](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmSliFf2ADk)\r\n\r\n\r\n### DATABASE CUSTOMISATION:\r\n\r\n`/dist/rsas.exe` embeds the artifacts database.\r\n\r\n> [Watch on YouTube How to use RSAS with a customized external database] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_SArYF-XUU)\r\n\r\nBefore using the embedded database, `rsas.exe` will look in the folder where itself is currently located for a `rsas.sqlite3` file. If present, RSAS will attempt to use such external file as artifact database, instead of the embedded one.\r\n\r\nThis allows the investigators to use their customised artifacts database.\r\n\r\nTo customise your artifacts database please do as follows:\r\n\r\n* copy [`/data/rsas.sqlite3`](./data/rsas.sqlite3) on your favorite location. This is a copy of the same database embedded in `rsas.exe`\r\n* open and edit your copy of `rsas.sqlite3` using a tool such as [SQLite Studio](http://sqlitestudio.pl/)\r\n* make sure your version of `rsas.sqlite3` is located in the same folder as `rsas.exe`, if you wish `rsas.exe` to use your database. Move `rsas.sqlite3` in a different location to make `rsas.exe` use the embedded database again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### EDITING THE DATABASE:\r\n\r\nRSAS does not come yet with a database-editing functionality.\r\nPlease use a tools such as [SQLite Studio](http://sqlitestudio.pl/) to edit the database.\r\nThe tables you are likely to be interested in editing are `artifacts` and `apps`.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### The `apps` table:\r\n\r\nYou will be interested in the fields `id` and `name`.\r\nPlease make sure `id` is a unique positive integer and `name` is a string without unusual characters.\r\nAny other field in the table is not used so far by RSAS, but you might be interested in using them for your own records, as you can save author, link, and other details for each application.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### The `artifacts` table:\r\n\r\nEach artifact description identifies one or more artifacts in the system which belongs to a specific application from the `apps` table.\r\n\r\nOf course each artifact has a unique positive integer `id` field, and an `app` field where the `id` of the corresponding application from the `apps` table should be stored.\r\n\r\nArtifacts are categorised in different types, using positive integers.\r\n\r\n* Artifact types between 1001 and 1999 are descriptions for **filesystem artifacts**.\r\n* Artifact types between 2001 and 2999 are descriptions for **Windows Registry artifacts**.\r\n\r\nSpecifically,\r\n\r\n* Type `1001` identifies **installation and configuration files**;\r\n* Type `1002` is dedicated to **Windows Prefetch files**;\r\n* Type `2001` identifies a **Registry Key, the very presence of which is considered evdence** that the corresponding applicaton was run in the system;\r\n* Type `2002` identifies a **Registry Key that should contain at least one value corresponding to a specified pattern** for it to be considered evidence that the application was run in the system.\r\n\r\nFor **Type-1000 artifacts (filesystem artifacts)**, the `path` field is used to describe the filepath.\r\nThe use of the wildcard `*` is allowed.\r\nDo not start the path with the disc unit letter.\r\nAs an example, an artifact such as `C:\\Windows\\Prefetch\\ANUBIS.EXE-8351B2F9.pf` should be described in the `path` field with the value `Windows\\Prefetch\\ANUBIS.EXE-*.pf`. This is because RSAS will look for that path into each connected hard drive or removable drive (discs and network drives are not included in this search).\r\n\r\n\r\nFor **Type-2000 artifacts (registry artifacts)**, the PATH field is used to describe the Registry Key path.\r\nThe use of the wildcard `*` is allowed.\r\nPlease make sure the path starts with one of the following short names for the main keys:\r\n\r\n| Short name to be used | Main Registry Key            |\r\n|-----------------------|------------------------------|\r\n| `HKU`                 | `HKEY_USERS`                 |\r\n| `HKCU`                | `HKEY_CURRENT_USER`          |\r\n| `HKCR`                | `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT`          |\r\n| `HKLM`                | `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE`         |\r\n| `HKPD`                | `HKEY_PERFORMANCE_DATA`      |\r\n| `HKCC`                | `HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG`        |\r\n| `HKDD`                | `HKEY_DYN_DATA`              |\r\n\r\nUsually, rather than using `HKCU\\your\\path`, it is preferrable to use `HKU\\*\\your\\path`, as this will look into `\\your\\path` for the `HKEY\\{ID}\\` key of each user, while `HKCU` is a link to the `HKEY\\{ID}\\` key of just the current user, which might not be the user which used the application you are scanning for.\r\n\r\nFor artifact of type `2002`, please use the `val` field to describe how to match the values in the key that will constitues your artifacts. It is highly suggested to make use of keywords with the help of the wildcard `*`.\r\n\r\nAny other field in the artifacts table is not currently used by RSAS. It might be worth using them to indicate in which versions of Windows the described artifact is expected to be found. If the DB will increase in size to the point that the scan will result too slow, future versions of RSAS might include a selective selection of artifacts from the DB, by choosing only those corresponding to the version of Windows of the target system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## ===== INSTRUCTIONS FOR DEVELOPERS: =====\r\n\r\n\r\n### SOURCE CODE:\r\n\r\nRSAS is developed in [Python v3.5](https://www.python.org) using [Object-Oriented Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming).\r\n\r\nThe Python code is included in the folder `/src/` and the main file `/rsas.py`.\r\n\r\nThe code is organised in 4 packages:\r\n\r\n| PACKAGE   | DESCRIPTION                                       |\r\n|-----------|---------------------------------------------------|\r\n| `src.cli` | for the **Command Line Interface**                |\r\n| `src.gui` | for the **Graphical User Interface**              |\r\n| `src.lib` | contains the **main libraries**, including `CONST`, `Scanner` and all the Object Classes used by `Scanner` such as `Apps`, `ArtifactRule`, and so on |\r\n| `src.db` | contanis libraries providing an **interface between RSAS and the chosen database** ([SQLite v.3](https://sqlite.org/)) |\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### DATABASE:\r\n\r\nRSAS uses an [SQLite v.3](https://sqlite.org/) database containing the Artifact descriptions that RSAS will use to look in the system for traces of removed applications.\r\n\r\nThe database is stored in [`/data/rsas.sqlite3`](./data/rsas.sqlite3).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### DISTRIBUTABLE:\r\n\r\nThe distributable version of the application is a single Windows executable file generated using [PyInstaller](http://www.pyinstaller.org/) and stored in [`/dist/rsas.exe`](https://github.com/nicolatalin/rsas/dist/rsas.exe).\r\n\r\nIn case you wish to modify the Python code and/or the SQLite DB, please build your new version of rsas.exe using the following command from the Windows Command Prompt:\r\n\r\n`pyinstaller -F rsas.spec`\r\n\r\nPlase make sure first that:\r\n* [Python 3.5](https://www.python.org/) and [PyInstaller](http://www.pyinstaller.org/) are propertly installed and configured in your system\r\n* your current working directory is the main directory of the *rsas* project\r\n* you are not using the **WRONG** command `pyinstaller -F rsas.py`, as such command would re-generate the `rsas.spec` file, and the [SQLite v.3](https://sqlite.org/) database would **NOT** be embedded in your `rsas.exe`\r\n\r\nPlease note that the `/build/` folder is created and used automatically by [PyInstaller](http://www.pyinstaller.org/).\r\n\r\n\r\n21 Aug 2016\r\n\r\n*Nicola Talin*\r\nnt271@kent.ac.uk\r\n",
